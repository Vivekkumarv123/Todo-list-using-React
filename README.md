# Todo-list-using-React

This is a simple Todo List application built using React. Users can add new tasks with titles and details, mark tasks as done, and delete tasks. The application manages two lists: one for active tasks and another for completed tasks. It also allows users to cancel completed tasks and move them back to the active list. The code is organized into functional components and utilizes React hooks such as `useState` for managing state. Additionally, it includes a Button component for handling user interactions.
